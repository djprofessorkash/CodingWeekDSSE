## Full-Stack ML Showcase

In this showcase, we'll demonstrate the steps to architecting a full-stack machine learning classification project from scratch for a basic use case.

Specifically, our use case will entail detecting and filtering spam content in text messages (and potentially other text content).

To activate the backend server for this project, execute the command `python app.py` from the command line after navigating to the `server` subdirectory.

To activate the frontend client for this project, execute the command `npm start` from the command line after navigating to the `client` subdirectory. 

Finally, to view the modeling process and machine learning pipeline, take a look at the `Modeling.ipynb` notebook located in the `server/research` nested subdirectory.
